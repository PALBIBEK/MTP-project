Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Open Domain Complex Question Answering (Ongoing)
As part of my Master's thesis, I am addressing open-domain complex question answering using benchmark datasets such as StrategyQA, FinQA, and WikiMultiHopQA. The project explores various retrieval techniques, including BM25, Facebook Contriever, and ColBERT, comparing their effectiveness in improving question answering accuracy. I developed an innovative document binning approach that combines retrieved and random documents to enhance contextual reasoning. Additionally, I experimented with several large language models, including LLAMA3 and Mistral, to optimize performance for answering complex questions.
